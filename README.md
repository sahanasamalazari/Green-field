## ðŸŒ±Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
* MongoDB Community Server (or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
* MongoDB Compass (optional, for GUI-based database management)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**


2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend # Navigate into the backend directory
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string.

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/greenfields_db
    ```

    (Replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/greenfields_db` with your actual MongoDB connection string if it's hosted elsewhere.)

4.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Navigate into the frontend directory
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../backend # Ensure you are in the backend directory
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the `PORT` you configured).

6.  **Open the frontend:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and open the `welcome.html` file in your web browser. Depending on your setup, you might use a live server extension in your IDE (like VS Code's Live Server) for better development experience.

## ðŸŒ±Usage

1.  **Access the Application:** Once the backend server is running, open the `welcome.html` file from the `frontend` directory in your web browser.
2.  **Login/Register:** You'll likely encounter a login/registration page first. Follow the prompts to create an administrator account.
3.  **Add New Worker:** Navigate to the "Workers" section and click on "**Add New Worker**" to create a new profile.
4.  **Manage Workers:** View a list of all workers. You can edit their details, change their status (**Current, Deleted, Archived**), or view their history.
5.  **Search & Filter:** Use the search bar and filter options to quickly find specific workers.
